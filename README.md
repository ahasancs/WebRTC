HTML + JavaScript: Full-Screen Screen Recording
A sample implementation of full-screen video recording from a browser, here's a basic working prototype using the MediaStream Recording API and the Screen Capture API. This demonstrates how to:

Request screen capture permission from the user
Record the screen in full-screen mode
Save the recording as a downloadable video (WebM format)

Note: This feature works in modern browsers, such as Chrome and Edge. Firefox also supports it with some differences. Safari support is limited.


Features
Records the screen in full-screen
Captures both video and system audio (if permissions allow)
Allows downloading the recording as .webm
Uses built-in browser APIs (no third-party libraries)
